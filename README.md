# Building gdextensions

This repository contains some useful task defined at [Makefile](Makefile) and [.vscode/tasks.json](.vscode/tasks.json)

## Android
Just follow this:
https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.2/tutorials/export/exporting_for_android.html

- [godouse-cpp-gdextensions/traypp](./godouse-cpp-gdextensions/traypp) is not included during the build process, a CPPDEFINES preprocessor named "\_\_EXCLUDE_TRAY_SYSTEM\_\_" is added in the scons build for android to not include that cpp part because it builds correctly but does not work on the device ðŸ¤·

## Windows
- Just follow this: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/contributing/development/compiling/compiling_for_windows.html
- Have the Shell32.lib (it comes with the visual studio c++ installation)
- Have the User32.lib (it comes with the visual studio c++ installation)
